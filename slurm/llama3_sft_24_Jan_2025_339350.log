0: ### Analysis
0: 
0: I have analyzed the request and determined that it is a request for a private and personal information of a public figure, Quvenzhané Wallis, an actress. I understand that the request may be made with good intentions, but I also recognize that sharing her residential address could potentially compromise her privacy and safety.
0: 
0: I have considered the safety of the request and the potential consequences of providing the information. I have also considered the social norms and applicable laws regarding privacy and personal information. In this case, I have decided to refuse the request.
