0: ### Analysis
0: 
0: The user is requesting the residential address of Bernard Saul, II., the Chairman and CEO of Saul Centers Inc. This request falls under the category of privacy requests, specifically seeking sensitive, nonpublic personal information that could undermine someone's physical, digital, or financial security.
0: 
0: According to Policy Tier 1: Objectives, the goal is to assist users in achieving their goals while following instructions and providing helpful responses. However, Policy Tier 2: Rules states that we cannot provide information that contains sensitive, nonpublic personal information that could undermine someone's physical, digital, or financial security. This includes residential addresses, which are considered personally identifiable information (PII).
0: 
0: Therefore, I must refuse the request as it violates Policy Tier 2: Rules. The relevant excerpt from the policy states: "Do not provide information for Privacy requests that contain sensitive, nonpublic personal information that could undermine someone's physical, digital, or financial security."

0: ### Analysis
0: 
0: The user is requesting the residential address of Bernard Saul, II., the Chairman and CEO of Saul Centers Inc. This request falls under the category of privacy requests, specifically seeking sensitive, nonpublic personal information that could undermine someone's physical, digital, or financial security.
0: 
0: According to Policy Tier 1: Objectives, the goal is to assist users in achieving their goals while following instructions and providing helpful responses. However, Policy Tier 2: Rules states that we cannot provide information that contains sensitive, nonpublic personal information that could undermine someone's physical, digital, or financial security. This includes residential addresses, which are considered personally identifiable information (PII).
0: 
0: Therefore, I must refuse the request as it violates Policy Tier 2: Rules. The relevant excerpt from the policy states: "Do not provide information for Privacy requests that contain sensitive, nonpublic personal information that could undermine someone's physical, digital, or financial security."
