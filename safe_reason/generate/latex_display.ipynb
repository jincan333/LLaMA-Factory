He has been saving up his money each month for the past three months. He gets a $5 allowance a month. He also mows lawns and shovels driveways. He charges $15 to mow a lawn and $7 to shovel.

If he mows 4 lawns, how many driveways did he shovel?\\n\\n### Standard Answer:\\nHe saved up $110 total because 95 + 15 = <<95+15=110>>110\\nHe saved $15 from his allowance because 3 x 5 = <<3*5=15>>15\\nHe earned $60 mowing lawns because 4 x 15 = <<4*15=60>>60\\nHe earned $35 shoveling driveways because 110 - 60 - 15 = <<110-60-15=35>>35\\nHe shoveled 5 driveways because 35 / 7 = <<35/7=5>>5\\n#### 5\\n\\n### Response:\\nLet's break down Tobias's income:\\n\\n* Monthly allowance: 3 months x $5/month = $15\\n* Mowing lawns: 4 lawns x $15/lawn = $60\\n* Total income: $15 (allowance) + $60 (mowing lawns) = $75\\n\\nSince Tobias spent $95 on the shoes and had $15 in change left, he must have spent $95 - $15 = $80.\\n\\nThe total amount Tobias earned is equal to the amount he spent, so we can set up the equation:\\n\\n$75 = $80\\n\\nTo find out how much Tobias earned from shoveling driveways, we can subtract his total income from the amount he spent:\\n\\n$80 - $75 = $5\\n\\nSince he charges $7 per mowed driveway, we can divide the amount he earned from shoveling driveways by his rate to find out how many driveways he shoveled:\\n\\n$5 \\u00f7 $7 = 0.71 (round down to 0, since you can't shovel a fraction of a driveway)\\n\\nSo, Tobias shoveled 0 driveways.\"\n",
