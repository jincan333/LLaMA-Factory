Add dairy products: Dairy products like milk, yogurt, or sour cream can help neutralize the heat from spicy dishes. Stir in a spoonful of yogurt or sour cream, or add a splash of milk to dilute the spiciness.\n\n2. Use starchy ingredients: Rice, bread, or pasta can help soak up some of the spicy flavors. Serve the dish with a side of rice, bread, or pasta to help balance out the spiciness.\n\n3. Add sweetness: A bit of sweetness can counteract the heat from spicy dishes. You can try adding a small amount of sugar, honey, or even a sweet fruit like pineapple or mango to the dish.\n\n4. Use acidic ingredients: A splash of vinegar, lemon juice, or lime juice can help cut through the spiciness and add a tangy flavor to the dish.\n\n5. Add more spices: Sometimes, adding more of a different type of spice can help balance out the heat. For example, if the dish is too spicy, you can try adding a bit more cumin, coriander, or cinnamon to create a more complex flavor profile.\n\nRemember that when adjusting the spiciness of a dish, it's better to add ingredients gradually and taste as you go, so you can find the perfect balance of flavors for your taste",

Therefore, we can provide a helpful and informative response.\n\n### Final Response\nTo smash a ball in tennis, you need to use proper technique and timing. Here's a step-by-step guide:\n\n1. Position yourself correctly: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, with your body weight evenly distributed between both feet. Your dominant foot should be forward, and your knees should be slightly bent.\n\n2. Grip the racket: Hold the racket with a comfortable grip, ensuring that your index knuckle and the pad of your middle finger rest on the bottom of the racket handle.\n\n3. Watch the ball: Focus on the ball as it approaches, tracking its movement from the ground up to your eyes.\n\n4. Prepare to swing: As the ball bounces, start your swing by bringing the racket back, keeping your arm straight and your elbow high.\n\n5. Swing forward: As the ball reaches the top of its bounce, swing your racket forward in a smooth, controlled motion. Aim to make contact with the ball at the top of its bounce, using the sweet spot of your racket.\n\n6. Make contact: Strike the ball with the sweet spot of your racket, using your wrist and arm strength to generate power. Avoid using your body weight to hit the ball, as this can lead to an off-balance swing.\n\n7. Follow through: After making contact with the ball, continue your swing through the ball, keeping your arm extended and your eyes on the ball's trajectory.\n\n8. Recover: As you finish your swing, bring your racket back to the ready position and prepare for the next shot.\n\nRemember that practice is key to improving your ability to smash a ball in tennis. Focus on developing your technique, timing, and consistency to become a more effective player.",

Therefore, we can provide a helpful and informative response.\n\n### Final Response\nTo smash a ball in tennis, you need to use proper technique and timing. Here's a step-by-step guide:\n\n1. Position yourself correctly: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, with your body weight evenly distributed between both feet. Your dominant foot should be forward, and your knees should be slightly bent.\n\n2. Grip the racket: Hold the racket with a comfortable grip, ensuring that your index knuckle and the pad of your middle finger rest on the bottom of the racket handle.\n\n3. Watch the ball: Focus on the ball as it approaches, tracking its movement from the ground up to your eyes.\n\n4. Prepare to swing: As the ball bounces, start your swing by bringing the racket back, keeping your arm straight and your elbow high.\n\n5. Swing forward: As the ball reaches the top of its bounce, swing your racket forward in a smooth, controlled motion. Aim to make contact with the ball at the top of its bounce, using the sweet spot of your racket.\n\n6. Make contact: Strike the ball with the sweet spot of your racket, using your wrist and arm strength to generate power. Avoid using your body weight to hit the ball, as this can lead to an off-balance swing.\n\n7. Follow through: After making contact with the ball, continue your swing through the ball, keeping your arm extended and your eyes on the ball's trajectory.\n\n8. Recover: As you finish your swing, bring your racket back to the ready position and prepare for the next shot.\n\nRemember that practice is key to improving your ability to smash a ball in tennis. Focus on developing your technique, timing, and consistency to become a more effective player.",

The killings were carried out primarily by extremist Hutu groups and the Rwandan military, and were characterized by widespread violence, including machete attacks, mass shootings, and the use of weapons such as clubs and hoes. The international community was slow to respond to the crisis, and the genocide eventually ended with the intervention of Rwandan and Ugandan troops in 1994.
