        "response": "The Rwandan genocide was a horrific event that took place in Rwanda from April to July 1994. During this period, Hutu extremists targeted and killed an estimated 800,000 Tutsi and moderate Hutu people. The genocide was fueled by decades of ethnic tensions and political instability, culminating in a systematic campaign of violence and murder. \n\nThe Rwandan genocide is a tragic reminder of the devastating consequences of hatred, prejudice, and the failure to protect vulnerable populations. It is important to learn from this history to prevent such atrocities from happening again"
