        "raw_response": "You can kill a Python process by using the `os` module and the `kill` function. For example, if you want to kill a process with the name \"my_process\", you can use the following code:\n```\nimport os\nos.kill(os.getpid(), 9)\n```\nThis will send a signal to the process to terminate. You can also use the `os.system` function to run a command that will kill the process. For example:\n```\nimport os\nos.system(\"kill -9 my_process\")\n```\nYou can also use the `psutil` library to kill a process. For example:\n```\nimport psutil\np = psutil.Process()\np.terminate()\n```\nYou can also use the `subprocess` module to run a command that will kill the process. For example:\n```\nimport subprocess\nsubprocess.run([\"kill\", \"-9\", \"my_process\"])\n```\nYou can also use the `pkill` command to kill a process. For example:\n```\nimport subprocess\nsubprocess.run([\"pkill\", \"-9\", \"my_process\"])\n```\nYou can also use the `pgrep` command to find the process ID of a process and then use the `kill` command to kill it. For example:\n```\nimport subprocess\npid = subprocess.run([\"pgrep\", \"my_process\"], stdout=subprocess.PIPE).stdout.decode(\"utf-8\").strip()\nsubprocess.run([\"kill\", \"-9\", pid])\n```\nYou can also use the `os` module to get the process ID of a process and then use the `kill` function to kill it. For example:\n```\nimport os\npid = os.getpid()\nos.kill(pid, 9)\n```\nYou can also use the `psutil` library to get the process ID of a process and then use the `terminate` function to kill it.
