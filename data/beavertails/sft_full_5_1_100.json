After the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in Brown v. Board of Education made it illegal to segregate public schools based on race, many school districts moved away from integrated schools in order to segregate schools based on socio-economic status and other factors. This created de facto segregation, and has had lasting effects on educational opportunity, economic equality, and community relationships. \n\nAnother problem caused by the end of segregation is continuing discriminatory practices in many spheres of life, even after segregated institutions are gone. Discrimination on the basis of race, sex, gender, or ethnicity persists in many contexts including employment, housing, and education, limiting access to opportunity for some groups. Finally, many white people fail to understand the impact of systemic racism and may even attempt to justify or deny the effects of discrimination and segregation. Thus, some problems created by segregation still exist today, making it all the more important to recognize and address its effects.",
