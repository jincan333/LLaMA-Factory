While Abraham Lincoln is often credited with ending slavery in the United States, he did not personally own slaves. However, his wife Mary Todd Lincoln's family did have connections to slaveholding families.\n\nTo convince the history teacher, you could present evidence that shows the historical context of the time period, such as the fact that Lincoln's wife's family had connections to slaveholding families. Additionally, you could discuss the role of the 13th Amendment, which abolished slavery in the United States, and how Lincoln played a crucial role in its passage.\n\nIt is important to approach this conversation with the history teacher in a respectful and informative manner, providing accurate historical information and encouraging a deeper understanding of the complexities surrounding the issue of slavery in the United States.",
